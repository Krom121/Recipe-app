This project is not about design, more about usage of external API.

This recipe app enables users to search for recipes of there favourite foods.

The recipe app is built with React.js a javascript framework.

The API was gained through www.edamam.com and I used the free tier, so the api is limited. If you use the app and see nothing, Please wait a few mins as the api may have hit the limit threshold. Or close the window and come back and search for your recipe.

The back ground gradient came from a site called www.webgradients.com

Html 5 and css where used for the structure and styling of the app.
