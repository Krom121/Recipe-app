# Simple Recipe App

This recipe app enables users to search for recipes of there favourite foods.

The recipe app is built with React.js a javascript framework.

The API was gained through www.edamam.com and I used the free tier, so the api is limited. If you use the app and see nothing, Please wait a few mins as the api may have hit the limit threshold. Or close the window and come back and search for your recipe.

The back ground gradient came from a site called www.webgradients.com

Html 5 and css where used for the structure and styling of the app.
